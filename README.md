Nested ToDoList, you can create tasks with progress bars that indicate how much of the task is done. 
You can click on the tasks to then open up the task details page, which then you can add steps to.
Now the progress bars don't update as intended, also only one step is shown at a time and the next ones only appear upon deleting the most recent step.

I will write a detailed readMe file describing what each of the classes do, but for now this is all the info.
